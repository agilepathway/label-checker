 **[GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) to check pull requests (PRs) for the presence or absence of specified labels**

---


## Why another label checker?

- We couldn't find another label checker that had all [our 4 check types](#checks) (`one_of`, `none_of`, `all_of`, `any_of`)

- **Speed**: the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/agilepathway/pull-request-label-checker)
  used for the checks is only 2.7 MB, so the checks are blazingly fast (c. 3 seconds)


## Using the Label Checker action

Using this action is as simple as:

1. **create a `.github\workflows` directory** in your repository
2. **create a 
   [YAML](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#about-yaml-syntax-for-workflows) 
   file** in the `.github\workflows` directory (file name can be anything you like, 
   with either a `.yml` or `.yaml` file extension), with this example content:
 
   ```
   ---
   name: Label Checker
   on:
     pull_request:
       types:
         - opened
         - synchronize
         - reopened
         - labeled
         - unlabeled
   
   jobs:
   
     check_labels:
       name: Check labels
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: docker://agilepathway/pull-request-label-checker:latest
           with:
             one_of: major,minor,patch
             repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
   ```

4. **customise the label checks** in the `with` section of the YAML file to fit your needs 

   (see the [checks](#checks) section below for the different checks you can configure)


## Checks

There are 4 types of label checks available:

- `one_of`  (PRs must have **exactly one** of these labels)

- `none_of` (PRs must have **none** of these labels)

- `all_of`  (PRs must have **all** of these labels)

- `any_of`  (PRs must have **one or more** of these labels)

You can have as many of the checks configured in the same YAML file as you like.

### Examples

- [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/): `one_of: major,minor,patch`

- Each PR must be a bug or an enhancement: `one_of: bug,enhancement`

- Prohibit certain labels: `none_of: invalid,wontfix,duplicate,question`

- Require each PR to have a certain label: `all_of: enhancement`

  or labels: `all_of: enhancement,reviewed`

- Require each PR to have one or more of these labels: `any_of: documentation,enhancement,bug`

- Combine multiple checks:

  ```
  with:
    one_of: major,minor,patch
    none_of: invalid,wontfix,duplicate,question
    any_of: documentation,enhancement,bug
    repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  ```

- Combine multiple checks of the same type:

  ```
  jobs:
   
    check_semver_label:
      name: Check for semantic version label
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: docker://agilepathway/pull-request-label-checker:latest
          with:
            one_of: major,minor,patch
            repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

    check_pull_request_type:
      name: Check for pull request type label
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: docker://agilepathway/pull-request-label-checker:latest
          with:
            one_of: bug,enhancement
            repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  ```


## Allow failure mode

You can set the label checker to not fail the build, even when a label check fails, and then use an
[`if` condition](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsif)
in a subsequent step or job to conditionally do something or not.
For example: check if a pull request has a `preview` label
and then only deploy an ephemeral environment if so.

Set the `allow_failure` mode as an input parameter in the 
[`with` section](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepswith): 
`allow_failure: true`

Example:

  ```
  steps:
    - id: preview_label_check
      uses: docker://agilepathway/pull-request-label-checker:latest
      with:
        all_of: preview
        repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        allow_failure: true
    - if: steps.preview_label_check.outputs.label_check == 'success'
      run: echo deploy to ephemeral environment
  ```

The label checker always exposes the `label_check` step output variable,
regardless of whether `allow_failure` is set or not.
The variable has a value of either `success` or `failure` which can then be queried in subsequent steps,
as in the above example.

## GitHub Enterprise

To use this label checker with [GitHub Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprise),
specify the GitHub Enterprise GraphQL URL in an input, e.g. for 
[Enterprise Cloud](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-github-enterprise-cloud):

   ```
   jobs:
   
     check_labels:
       name: Check labels
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: docker://agilepathway/pull-request-label-checker:latest
           with:
             github_enterprise_graphql_url: https://api.github.com/graphql
             one_of: major,minor,patch # just an example
             repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
   ```

  or for
  [Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server/admin/overview/about-github-enterprise-server):

   ```
   jobs:
   
     check_labels:
       name: Check labels
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: docker://agilepathway/pull-request-label-checker:latest
           with:
             github_enterprise_graphql_url: https://<hostname>/api/graphql
             one_of: major,minor,patch # just an example
             repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
   ```
